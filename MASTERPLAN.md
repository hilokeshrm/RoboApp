# RoboApp: Offline Voice-Activated Chat Assistant


##üìå Overview & Objectives
RoboApp is a voice-activated offline chat assistant designed for mobile (Android) devices. The app wakes upon hearing a custom wake word and allows users to speak simple phrases in Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, or Tamil. It processes commands entirely offline and responds out loud using local text-to-speech. The goal is to deliver a fast, multilingual, private voice assistant experience tailored for users in India.

## üéØ Target Audience
‚Ä¢	Users in India needing multilingual support (especially regional languages)
‚Ä¢	Users concerned with privacy or operating in low/no connectivity environments
‚Ä¢	Developers or researchers who want to gather voice and chat data for further training


## üß© Core Features & Functionality
‚Ä¢	Offline wake-word detection to launch app
‚Ä¢	Multilingual offline speech-to-text (Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil)
‚Ä¢	Basic command understanding (rule/keyword-based)
‚Ä¢	Offline text-to-speech (response in the same language)
‚Ä¢	Visual chat history view (GUI)
‚Ä¢	Local caching and storing of chat + audio
‚Ä¢	Persistent background listening


## üí° High-Level Technical Stack Suggestions

## Platform: Android Native (Kotlin/Java) or Flutter

### Wake Word Detection:
‚Ä¢	Snowboy (deprecated but usable offline)
‚Ä¢	Picovoice Porcupine (modern, lightweight, multilingual support)

### Speech-to-Text:
‚Ä¢	Vosk (offline, supports Indian languages)
‚Ä¢	Mozilla DeepSpeech (if customized)

### Text-to-Speech (TTS):
‚Ä¢	Coqui TTS (for offline synthesis)
‚Ä¢	RHVoice or Festival (for regional TTS voices)

### Local Database:
‚Ä¢	SQLite (simple, reliable)
‚Ä¢	Hive (if using Flutter)

### Background Services:
‚Ä¢	Android Foreground Service (to keep listening for wake word)

## Optional Tooling:
‚Ä¢	TensorFlow Lite (for on-device ML in future)
‚Ä¢	Language Detection via compact rule-based system or trained lightweight model

## üóÇÔ∏è Conceptual Data Model
‚Ä¢	Chats: { message_id, timestamp, text, language, audio_path, response_text }
‚Ä¢	Audio Recordings: Stored locally with links to chats
‚Ä¢	Command History: List of recognized commands with usage frequency
‚Ä¢	Session Cache: Temporary in-memory storage during active chat

## üé® User Interface Design Principles
‚Ä¢	Minimal UI, launches on wake word
‚Ä¢	Clean, conversational display (chat bubbles or timeline)
‚Ä¢	Voice playback button for each message (if needed)
‚Ä¢	Microphone visual cues during listening
‚Ä¢	Language-indicative colors/icons

## üîê Security Considerations
‚Ä¢	All data is stored locally; no cloud sync
‚Ä¢	Optional future: On-device encryption for audio/chat
‚Ä¢	Microphone permissions handled clearly to gain user trust

## üöß Development Phases
### Phase 1: Core MVP
‚Ä¢	Wake word activation (offline)
‚Ä¢	Basic multilingual STT + TTS
‚Ä¢	Visual chat history
‚Ä¢	Background service
‚Ä¢	Local database integration

### Phase 2: Data Collection & Optimization
‚Ä¢	Store audio + text logs for training
‚Ä¢	Improve TTS/STT accuracy per language
‚Ä¢	Language detection fine-tuning

### Phase 3: Smarter Commands
‚Ä¢	Add more rule-based commands
‚Ä¢	Command chaining and context memory

### Phase 4: UI/UX Polish
‚Ä¢	Add personality to responses
‚Ä¢	Voice customization
‚Ä¢	Basic settings panel

## üå± Future Expansion Possibilities
‚Ä¢	Add more Indian languages
‚Ä¢	AI-driven offline chatbot (on-device inference)
‚Ä¢	Voice biometric login or user recognition
‚Ä¢	Sync across devices via encrypted peer-to-peer
‚Ä¢	Personalizable wake word
‚Ä¢	Privacy controls for local data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Technical Challenges & Suggestions
‚Ä¢	Multilingual TTS/STT size: Choose models carefully to reduce APK size
‚Ä¢	Battery drain from background listening: Use low-power audio polling and foreground services
‚Ä¢	Accent variability: Plan for region-specific pronunciation datasets in future training
